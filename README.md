I'm very happy that I had the idea to create this extension 2 years before the chrome team decided to add it. I used this extension countless times and even though its very simple, it's one of my favorite personal projects.

# QRCodeAnywhere

A simple chrome extension to display a page's QR code
 
## Why did I make this extension?
I had an insanely long url on my computer and I wanted to easily get that same page open on my phone. All I have do to is click the icon (or press `Ctrl + Shift + A`) and scan the code on my phone and voila.

## Why is this not on the chrome web store?
To publish an application on the chrome web store you have to pay a fee and I don't really care about doing that

## Installation

1. Download and extract the repository.
2. Run `QRCodeAnywhere.crx`
3. Enjoy

Alternatively you could:
1. Download and extract the repository.
2. Visit chrome://extensions, enable Developer Mode on the top right.
3. Click Load unpacked on the top left and select the folder that holds the repository.
4. Disable Developer Mode once the extension has appeared.
5. Enjoy
