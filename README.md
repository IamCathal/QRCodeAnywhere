# QRCodeAnywhere
 A simple chrome extension to display a page's QR code

## Why did I make this extension?
I had an insanely long url on my computer and I wanted to easily get that same page open on my phone. All I have do to is click the icon (or press `Ctrl + Shift + A`) and scan the code on my phone and voila.

## Why is this not on the chrome web store?
To publish an application on the chrome web store you have to pay a fee and I don't really care about doing that

## Installation
